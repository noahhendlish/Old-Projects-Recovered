This manual describes how to operate the Lost Rovers game.

Once the GUI loads, you should be able to see a small flea-like icon amongst cabbage, nails, gears, cakes, portals, 
and broken ship parts. This flea-like critter is your rover, and will be what you are controlling in this game. 

To move, use your arrow keys or the keys located on the window. 

The space bar picks up items, or you may use the “Pick up” button on the window. 

The bulls-eye icon on the screen are portals, and once you pass over one you will be teleported to another room. 

If you become lost amongst the rooms, the “Show the way back” button will highlight which portal you should take 
to have the quickest route back to your ship. 

The task at hand should be visible at the top of the screen, and once you have collected all of the required items,
move your rover over the part to be fixed and press the “Perform Task” button. 

Once all tasks have been completed, you win and your rover can return home!
